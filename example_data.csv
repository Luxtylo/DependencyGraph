SyRS-4206,The SFECU Channel's response to a Valid Lever Movement shall be to indicate a Valid Lever Command has been received providing that the Flight Leg of SyRS-6168 is not ?Unknown?,ECU15563,Requirement
SyDD1534,"For the selected F1 Detent Position there exists a related PDU angular position to which the system must be driven (and monitored against), known as the Demanded Position. 
The Demanded Position is obtained by lookup of the selected Detent PDU Positions on receipt of a Valid Lever Command (see below). 
 
The lookup requires the following: 
 
F1 Detent Position (see SyDD-1880) 
Detent PDU Position Selection (see SyDD-1881) 
 
It is a project decision to generate the Demanded Position in the 'Interpret Pilot Inputs' (IPI) function:- 
[RATIONALE: IPI is selected as a dissimilar S/W function inline with system monitoring (to meet integrity requirements).  Position-error monitoring e.g. runaway needs the Demanded Position.] ",SyRS-4206,Design Statement
SyRS-1408,Initial SFECU deliveries i.e. varient 0 shall provide the Detent PDU Positions defined at SyRS-4209,ECU15563,Requirement
